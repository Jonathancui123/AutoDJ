1. Increase top tracks count (100 -> 200? 250?)
2. Account for missing input values on Select
3. Whatever that display error was that I just sent u
4. ADD: Save & open playlist in Spotify option for guests, open in Spotify option for host

NOTE: Test if the environment variable for react works with heroku (it may be unable to communicate with backend)
Maybe somehow show the person that contributed to each song?

REACT:
// Implement "guest" view
Create page:
Tell the host to expect a playlist to be created on their account
Automatically refresh info on party page for all members when new people join (don't require manual refresh) and when the owner changes the genre/duration--> use SOCKET.IO


SERVER:
Extrapolate to find songs that will truly satisfy everyone. Perhaps by an artist similarity API?
Search for the desired genre in Spotify's genre names e.g. "pop rap" <= pop
Query everyone's names in the same call as their tastes profile from spotify
Handle the case where there are insufficient songs in the songbank needed for the requested duration
Order the songs by BPM/Pitch/Something useful
Perform a check to see if the saved spotify ID exists as a playlist (Editing playlists from previous sessions)
How will we update out-of-date information in our database?
